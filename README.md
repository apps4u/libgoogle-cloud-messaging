# Google Cloud Messaging for C++

`libgoogle-cloud-messaging` permits local C++ applications to communicate
with Google and down with Android devices.

## About GCM (Google Cloud Messaging)
[Google](http://www.google.com) provides [Android](http://www.android.com) with
this neat functionality similar to [D-Bus](http://dbus.freedesktop.org) or
[COM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model) over HTTP(S).
Information about *GCM* can be found [here](http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm).

## Building
For now, and for simplicity, I used [Qt](http://qt-project.org) and
[QJson](http://qjson.sourceforge.net). With enough help and time on my hands,
I plan to refactor out the project so that the underlying functionality remains
solid. However, I think that many might find Qt to be the best solution for this.

## Contributing
Fork, make a topic branch, squash commit and then pull request! I'm very
open to ideas and always up for a new trick.
